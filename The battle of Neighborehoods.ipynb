Therefore it is necessary to make a good analysis of the location, in a first step of the neighborhood, of the restaurant before starting the operation. Thats why the stakeholders would care about this project.  <br> \nSome key aspects to take into account for this analysis are:\n1. Parking.\n2. Visibility.\n3. Number of people who can pass near the restaurant.\n4. Income of the Neighborhood.\n5. Presence of near similiar restaurants.\n6. Presence of other business that can attract people to the restaurant: Stadiums, parks, theaters, medical majors.\n\n\n"
